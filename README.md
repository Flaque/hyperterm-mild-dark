# Mild Dark Theme for Hyper

Theme for [Hyper](https://hyper.is) (previously HyperTerm).

![screenshot](http://zacanger.com/hyperterm.png)

Forked from the [Atom One Dark Theme for HyperTerm](https://github.com/mdo/hyperterm-atom-dark)
by @mdo, which was forked from @jxnblk's
[HyperTerminator](https://github.com/jxnblk/hyperterminator).

AFAICT this was maybe the third theme out there for HyperTerm, so it may not
be taking advantage of newer HyperTerm features or options.

If it doesn't quite suit you, you should check out other themes
[here](https://hyperthemes.matthi.coffee)!

## Install

* `$EDITOR ~/.hyperterm.js` (or `CMD+,` in Hyper)
* Add `hyperterm-mild-dark` to your plugins array.
* Reload (`CMD+Shift+R`)

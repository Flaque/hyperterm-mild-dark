# Mild Dark Theme for HyperTerm

Forked from the [Atom One Dark Theme for HyperTerm](https://github.com/mdo/hyperterm-atom-dark) by @mdo,
which was forked from @jxnblk's [HyperTerminator](https://github.com/jxnblk/hyperterminator).

### Install

1. Open HyperTerm's preferences with `Cmd+,` (or manually at `~/.hyperterm.js`) with your editor.
2. Update your list of plugins to include `hyperterm-mild-dark`, like so:

```javascript
plugins : [ 'hyperterm-atom-dark' ]
```

3. Fully reload HyperTerm (`Cmd+Shift+R), and tada!
